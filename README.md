# Blogly

This is a full stack web application I created for practice. Users can create, read, update, delete, and like blog posts. The data is stored in a local mongodb database. 

You can clone this repository with

```
git clone https://github.com/lilyjge/Blogly.git
```

You need nodejs and mongodb installed. To run the application, use the following commands

```
npm install
node index.js
```

You can then see the application live at http://localhost:3000/posts.
